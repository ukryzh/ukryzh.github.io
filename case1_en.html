    <p></p>

    <p><b>1. Introduction</b></p>
    <p><b>1.1. Purpose of the analysis</b></p>
    <p>To study the process parameters: execution speed, cost/expenses of the process, process results (quality of the
      output product).</p>
    <p>To analyze the possibilities of optimization and automation, improve the process parameters.</p>
    <p><b>1.2. Description of the analyzed process</b></p>
    <p>The business process "Verification of client data (individuals) within the lending process" is a
      component of the lending process block in the Bank. The lending block for individuals is critical for the Bank, since 30% of the profit earned in the Bank comes from
      this Block.</p>
    <p>The main purpose of the verification process is to check the client's data for compliance with their
      legal requirements and the Bank's internal requirements. Based on the verification results, a decision is made to
      approve/refuse lending.</p>
    <p><b>1.3. Sources of information</b></p>
    <p>As part of the preparation for analysis and collection of information stage:</p>
    <ul class="skill-list-small">
      <li>interviews are conducted with performers, managers and owners of the process;
        as part of the interviews, the process execution is monitored in real time;</li>
      <li>data from information systems in which employees work to execute this process (task & process mining) are
        collected;</li>
      <li>local legal acts/internal regulatory documentation (LLA/IRD) are analyzed;</li>
      <li>regulatory regulations of state actors and other financial institutions are analyzed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>1. Automation of routine tasks using artificial intelligence tools.</p>
    <p>To automate the verifier's tasks, it is possible to propose implementing RPA.
      Since the main advantage of RPA is interaction with the GUI, using this technology seems to be the best option.

    <p>A new approach to process management may look like this:</p>
    <ul class="skill-list-small">
      <li>RPA is orchestrated using Camunda or another BPM system (PEGA, Business Studio)</li>
      <li>Information on completed operations is logged for subsequent analysis and building predictive models</li>
      <li>If changes occur in the process, they are entered into the BPM system and the RPA behavior algorithm</li>
      <li>The effectiveness of the process and its changes are assessed in the BPM system</li>

    <p><b>4.4. Implementation plan</b></p>

    <p>In this case, the Bank already has a Process Optimization Office, which is engaged in, among other things, the
      implementation of AI tools to improve process efficiency.
      Thus, the Process Optimization Office acts as the executor in this implementation project. </p>
    <p>Proposed stages:</p>
    <p>1. Identification of stakeholders (process owner, process managers, verifiers and other Bank employees)
      <br>2. Calculation of Cost-Benefit analysis/ROI based on the results of the process analysis.
      <br>3. Description of the TO-BE process using RPA technology. Collection and formalization of requirements for the
      RPA scenario.
      <br>4. Designing a test instance of the process using RPA technology.
      <br>5. Testing on a pilot group (a limited number of loan applications) and improving the process instance.
      <br>6. Assessing the transformation of the personnel and preparing new roles for employees. Training/transferring
      employees involved in the process.
      <br>7. Full-scale implementation of RPA in the process with a complete replacement of employee functionality.
      Creation of documentation (regulations/procedures/instructions).
      <br>8. Assessing the effectiveness of the implementation within 2-4 weeks after implementation, recording the
      first results.
    </p>

    <p>This implementation project can take from 2 weeks to 1 month. The process owner and the Process Optimization
      Office are appointed as those responsible for the project. </p>
