  <h2>Development of a project dashboard</h2>
  <p></p>
  <p>As part of the case, a dashboard was developed to track the status of projects for the implementation of AI tools
    in the Bank's business processes.</p>
  <p><b>Toolkit:</b></p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>SQL (SQL Server Management Studio)</td>
      <td>Power BI</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p></p>
  <p><b>Goal:</b> Creating a tool that allows real-time monitoring of the current status and progress of AI
    implementation projects.</p>
  <p><b>Result:</b> An interactive dashboard in Power BI reflecting the status of all projects within the framework of
    the AI ​​implementation strategy in the Bank.</p>

  <p>Data generated based on the implementation strategy was used for visualization AI tools
    (data example: <a href="../case4/assets/raw_data_en.csv" target="_blank">raw_data.csv</a>)</p>
  <p>The data was pre-loaded into the database on the server (SSMS) for easy updating and scaling. Then, a connection to
    the server was configured in Power BI for automatic loading and processing of information.</p>

  <p><b>Building a dashboard:</b></p>

  <p>1. To calculate non-standard visual elements, such as cards displaying the number of projects, measures written in
    DAX were used.</p>
  <p>2. The table implemented a conditional formatting system for the "Planned Completion Date" column: cells with
    approaching deadlines are highlighted in a different color to improve visibility and ease of perception.</p>
